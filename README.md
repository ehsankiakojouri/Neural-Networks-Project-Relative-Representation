# UPDATE:
There are minor inconsistencies between networks in the visualization of low-dimensional latent space. This phenomenon is explained by the insights discussed in the paper: "Challenges in Explaining Representational Similarity through Identifiability" [Nielsen et al., 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SQKUZSieVg). UniReps: 2nd Edition of the Workshop on Unifying Representations in Neural Models.

# Neural Networks Course Project

This repository contains the code for my neural networks course project. All experiments and analyses were conducted on Kaggle.

## Installation

To set up the project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Code
Each script in the repository can be run separately. Make sure to install the dependencies first before executing any script.

## Experiments
All experiments were performed on Kaggle. If you wish to replicate the experiments, you can upload the code to Kaggle and run it there.
